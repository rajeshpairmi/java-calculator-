- It is also software management project build tool.
# What type of applications can be packaged using Maven?
- Using Maven, we can create 3 types of files:
    - Standalone application: .jar
    - Webbased Java application: .war
    - Enterprise Java application: .ear
# What is the difference between Maven build and Docker build?
Maven build helps to build the application packages from the source code.
- Application Source code - Compile - build as an aritifact (.jar, .war, zip folder etc)
Docker build is build a image with arcifacts and their dependancies in one container, and run them. 
In short, Maven is the application build tool, however, Docker help to deploy containers using images which is a package of artifacts for maven + java + dependancies.
# Usecase1:
